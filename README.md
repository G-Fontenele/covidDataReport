# covidDataReport

This ia a repository used for data analysis of the COVID-19 desease I created to help me understanding how it was spreading throughout the world. It is a project with no institucional relations and there is no mean of continuing with it at the moment. It comes with a tkinter GUI, that allows user to view a lot of chart options from brasil and all countries.

The reason this project was not finished was due to changes on the brasilian data source. This changes would implicate in a whole new method for reading and treating brasil corona virus cases. That's why I decided to finish the project. It demotivated me. It's not as well commented I would Like it to be.

Fell free to read and use it.
