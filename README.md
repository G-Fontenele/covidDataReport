# covidDataReport
This ia a repository used for simple data analysis of the COVID-19 desease I created to help me understanding how it was spreading throughout the world.

Also, it comes with a tkinter GUI, tahat allows user to view a lot of chart options from brasil and all countries.

This project was not finished due to changes on the brasilian data source. This changes would implicate in a whole new method for reading and treating brasil corona virus cases. That's why I decided to finish the project.It's not as well commented I would Like it to be.

Fell free to read and use it.

The dataset is coming from this link: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases
